# SIDE BY SIDE

Side by Side is an application made with ReactJs for studying purposees at the Front-End Developer course - Kenzie Academy Brazil.

## Team

This project was developed by the team: Victor Martins, Ayana Mello, Gabriel Bueno, Lucas Rozado and Mateus Gava. We created together all the concepts, design and coding of the application.

## Server

We used [json-server](https://github.com/victorsnms/side-by-side-json-server) library deployed in Heroku.
The routes are used to login, signup and managing the waste points and events markers.

## About the application

**Side By Side** is an application that contributes to the environment by engaging the users in participating and creating environmental events and also helps them to find suitable places to dispose of their garbage next to their local area.

The team decided that involving the community in this types of events would have numerous benefits. So an user can create or participate in events where other users would commit to helping by cleaning, providing tools, managing, etc. There is also a "gamification" as a form of encouragement: for each event or collection point created, the user is rewarded with points and earns badges.

## API Google Maps

We used Google Maps API to display the interactive map where the user can check and create markers.

## Tools and libraries

* [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom): pages routes;
* [yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup), [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/): forms;
* [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/) styling;

### TypeScript

We choose to use Typescript to have a stronger typed programming language than Javascript.
